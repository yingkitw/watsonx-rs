# TODO

## Completed

✅ **Initial SDK Implementation**
- Basic client implementation with authentication
- Configuration management via environment variables
- Text generation with streaming support
- Error handling with comprehensive error types
- Quality assessment for generated text
- Multiple IBM Granite model support

✅ **Build Fixes**
- engineered ambiguous glob re-exports by removing duplicate constants
- Fixed type mismatch in `with_tokens_used()` method
- Fixed unused variable warnings

✅ **Streaming Implementation**
- Fixed `perform_generation` to use `.bytes_stream()` instead of `.text()`
- Implemented proper Server-Sent Events (SSE) parsing
- Real-time streaming output with callbacks

✅ **Model Listing API**
- Added `list_models()` method to fetch available models from WatsonX API
- Added `ModelInfo` struct to represent model information
- Created `list_models.rs` example demonstrating model listing
- Updated documentation with model listing functionality

✅ **Non-streaming Generation API**
- Implemented `generate_text()` method using `/ml/v1/text/generation` endpoint
- Added `perform_text_generation()` internal method
- Renamed `generate_stream_with_callback()` to `generate_text_stream()` for consistency
- Renamed `perform_generation()` to `perform_text_stream_generation()` for consistency
- Created `streaming_vs_non_streaming.rs` example comparing both methods
- Updated all examples and documentation with consistent method names
- Added non-streaming flow to architecture documentation

✅ **Documentation Improvements**
- Completely rewrote README with focus on easy learning and usage patterns
- Added clear model selection requirement in all examples
- Added "Available Models" section with popular model recommendations
- Added dynamic model discovery examples
- Emphasized WatsonX platform vision (ai, data, governance, orchestrate)
- Created pattern-based learning approach instead of API reference style

✅ **Crates.io Publishing Fix**
- Fixed Cargo.toml categories to use supported crates.io category slugs
- Removed unsupported "artificial-intelligence" category
- Updated to use "api-bindings", "web-programming", "text-processing"

✅ **Build Size Optimization**
- Removed unnecessary dependencies (anyhow, async-trait, url)
- Optimized Tokio features to only essential ones (rt, rt-multi-thread, net, time, macros)
- Disabled reqwest default features and enabled only needed ones
- Added release profile optimizations (opt-level = "z", lto = true, strip = true)
- Reduced library size to 617KB and example binary to 1.7MB

✅ **Project Configuration**
- Updated .gitignore with comprehensive Rust development patterns
- Added exclusions for build artifacts, IDE files, OS files, and temporary data
- Included environment variable files and profiling data exclusions

✅ **WatsonX Orchestrate SDK Implementation**
- Implemented comprehensive OrchestrateClient matching wxo-client-main pattern
- Simplified OrchestrateConfig (only instance_id and region, removed api_url and timeout)
- Added `list_agents()` method for agent discovery
- Implemented `send_message()` for non-streaming chat with conversation continuity
- Implemented `stream_message()` for real-time streaming chat responses
- Uses `/runs/stream` endpoint matching wxo-client pattern
- Parses SSE events (message.created, message.delta) correctly
- Maintains thread_id for conversation context
- Added support for document collections and vector search capabilities
- Created comprehensive type definitions (Agent, Message, MessagePayload, etc.)
- Added `from_env()` method for simple environment-based configuration
- Created orchestrate_example.rs for basic agent listing
- Created orchestrate_chat.rs for complete chat workflow demonstration
- Added unit tests for all Orchestrate functionality

## Recent Fixes & Enhancements

✅ **Orchestrate Stream Parsing Fix (FINAL)**
- Fixed `stream_message()` to correctly parse `message.delta` events
- Corrected to access nested `data.delta.content[0].text` structure (primary path)
- Added fallback to `data.content[0].text` for compatibility
- Streaming callbacks now fire properly for each text delta received from API
- Verified with real Watson Orchestrate API responses
- Both main stream loop and remaining buffer processing updated

✅ **Advanced Orchestrate Capabilities Added**
- **Run Management**: `get_run()`, `list_runs()`, `cancel_run()` for tracking execution
- **Thread Management**: `create_thread()`, `delete_thread()` for conversation lifecycle
- **Tool Execution**: `execute_tool()` for direct tool invocation
- **Batch Operations**: `send_batch_messages()` for processing multiple messages
- **New Types**: `RunInfo`, `RunStatus`, `ToolExecutionRequest`, `ToolExecutionResult`, `BatchMessageRequest`, `BatchMessageResponse`, `AgentExecutionConfig`

✅ **Comprehensive Examples Added**
- `orchestrate_advanced.rs` - Full capability demonstration with all features
- `orchestrate_use_cases.rs` - Practical use cases (multi-turn chat, document search, tool integration, run tracking, skill discovery)
- `orchestrate_chat.rs` - Complete chat workflow with streaming
- `orchestrate_example.rs` - Basic agent listing

✅ **SDK Robustness Improvements**
- Made Tool fields optional (`tool_type`, `config`) to handle varying API responses
- Implemented flexible response parsing for list endpoints
- Added fallback parsing for wrapped responses (e.g., `{tools: [...]}`)
- Graceful degradation for unavailable endpoints (returns empty collections)
- Fixed tools listing - now correctly parses tool responses
- Improved error handling in examples with info messages for optional features

## Notes

### WatsonX AI (watsonx.ai)
- Supports both streaming (`generate_text_stream`) and non-streaming (`generate_text`) endpoints
- Authentication tokens are not cached (re-authenticates on each connection)
- Configuration is primarily via `.env` files for security

### WatsonX Orchestrate (watsonx.orchestrate)
- Simplified configuration following wxo-client-main pattern (only instance_id and region)
- Uses `/runs/stream` endpoint for all chat interactions (matches wxo-client)
- Supports both streaming (`stream_message`) and non-streaming (`send_message`) chat
- Maintains conversation context via thread_id (returned and managed by caller)
- Uses `IAM-API_KEY` header authentication (not Bearer token)
- Parses Orchestrate-specific SSE events (message.created, message.delta)
