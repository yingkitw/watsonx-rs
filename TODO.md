# TODO

## Completed

✅ **Initial SDK Implementation**
- Basic client implementation with authentication
- Configuration management via environment variables
- Text generation with streaming support
- Error handling with comprehensive error types
- Quality assessment for generated text
- Multiple IBM Granite model support

✅ **Build Fixes**
- engineered ambiguous glob re-exports by removing duplicate constants
- Fixed type mismatch in `with_tokens_used()` method
- Fixed unused variable warnings

✅ **Streaming Implementation**
- Fixed `perform_generation` to use `.bytes_stream()` instead of `.text()`
- Implemented proper Server-Sent Events (SSE) parsing
- Real-time streaming output with callbacks

✅ **Model Listing API**
- Added `list_models()` method to fetch available models from WatsonX API
- Added `ModelInfo` struct to represent model information
- Created `list_models.rs` example demonstrating model listing
- Updated documentation with model listing functionality

✅ **Non-streaming Generation API**
- Implemented `generate_text()` method using `/ml/v1/text/generation` endpoint
- Added `perform_text_generation()` internal method
- Renamed `generate_stream_with_callback()` to `generate_text_stream()` for consistency
- Renamed `perform_generation()` to `perform_text_stream_generation()` for consistency
- Created `streaming_vs_non_streaming.rs` example comparing both methods
- Updated all examples and documentation with consistent method names
- Added non-streaming flow to architecture documentation

✅ **Documentation Improvements**
- Completely rewrote README with focus on easy learning and usage patterns
- Added clear model selection requirement in all examples
- Added "Available Models" section with popular model recommendations
- Added dynamic model discovery examples
- Emphasized WatsonX platform vision (ai, data, governance, orchestrate)
- Created pattern-based learning approach instead of API reference style

✅ **Crates.io Publishing Fix**
- Fixed Cargo.toml categories to use supported crates.io category slugs
- Removed unsupported "artificial-intelligence" category
- Updated to use "api-bindings", "web-programming", "text-processing"

✅ **Build Size Optimization**
- Removed unnecessary dependencies (anyhow, async-trait, url)
- Optimized Tokio features to only essential ones (rt, rt-multi-thread, net, time, macros)
- Disabled reqwest default features and enabled only needed ones
- Added release profile optimizations (opt-level = "z", lto = true, strip = true)
- Reduced library size to 617KB and example binary to 1.7MB

✅ **Project Configuration**
- Updated .gitignore with comprehensive Rust development patterns
- Added exclusions for build artifacts, IDE files, OS files, and temporary data
- Included environment variable files and profiling data exclusions

✅ **WatsonX Orchestrate SDK Implementation**
- Implemented comprehensive OrchestrateClient matching wxo-client-main pattern
- Simplified OrchestrateConfig (only instance_id and region, removed api_url and timeout)
- Added `list_agents()` method for agent discovery
- Implemented `send_message()` for non-streaming chat with conversation continuity
- Implemented `stream_message()` for real-time streaming chat responses
- Uses `/runs/stream` endpoint matching wxo-client pattern
- Parses SSE events (message.created, message.delta) correctly
- Maintains thread_id for conversation context
- Added support for document collections and vector search capabilities
- Created comprehensive type definitions (Agent, Message, MessagePayload, etc.)
- Added `from_env()` method for simple environment-based configuration
- Created orchestrate_example.rs for basic agent listing
- Created orchestrate_chat.rs for complete chat workflow demonstration
- Added unit tests for all Orchestrate functionality

## Current Status

The SDK is fully functional with:

### WatsonX AI Features
- ✅ Real-time streaming text generation (`generate_text_stream()`)
- ✅ Standard text generation (`generate_text()`)
- ✅ Proper SSE parsing for WatsonX streaming endpoint
- ✅ Environment-based configuration
- ✅ Multiple model support with updated constants
- ✅ Model listing API integration (`list_models()`)
- ✅ Quality assessment tools
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Working examples with consistent method names

### WatsonX Orchestrate Features
- ✅ Agent discovery (`list_agents()`)
- ✅ Non-streaming chat with conversation continuity (`send_message()`)
- ✅ Streaming chat with real-time callbacks (`stream_message()`)
- ✅ Thread-based conversation context management
- ✅ Simplified configuration (`from_env()` with just WXO_INSTANCE_ID and WXO_REGION)
- ✅ Matches wxo-client-main pattern and API structure
- ✅ Complete chat example (`orchestrate_chat.rs`)
- ✅ Document collection and vector search capabilities (infrastructure ready)

## Future Improvements

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add more code comments
- [ ] Refactor for better separation of concerns
- [ ] Add clippy lints
- [ ] Improve error messages

## Notes

### WatsonX AI (watsonx.ai)
- Supports both streaming (`generate_text_stream`) and non-streaming (`generate_text`) endpoints
- Authentication tokens are not cached (re-authenticates on each connection)
- Configuration is primarily via `.env` files for security

### WatsonX Orchestrate (watsonx.orchestrate)
- Simplified configuration following wxo-client-main pattern (only instance_id and region)
- Uses `/runs/stream` endpoint for all chat interactions (matches wxo-client)
- Supports both streaming (`stream_message`) and non-streaming (`send_message`) chat
- Maintains conversation context via thread_id (returned and managed by caller)
- Uses `IAM-API_KEY` header authentication (not Bearer token)
- Parses Orchestrate-specific SSE events (message.created, message.delta)
