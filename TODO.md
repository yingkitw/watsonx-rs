# TODO

## Completed

✅ **Initial SDK Implementation**
- Basic client implementation with authentication
- Configuration management via environment variables
- Text generation with streaming support
- Error handling with comprehensive error types
- Quality assessment for generated text
- Multiple IBM Granite model support

✅ **Build Fixes**
- engineered ambiguous glob re-exports by removing duplicate constants
- Fixed type mismatch in `with_tokens_used()` method
- Fixed unused variable warnings

✅ **Streaming Implementation**
- Fixed `perform_generation` to use `.bytes_stream()` instead of `.text()`
- Implemented proper Server-Sent Events (SSE) parsing
- Real-time streaming output with callbacks

✅ **Model Listing API**
- Added `list_models()` method to fetch available models from WatsonX API
- Added `ModelInfo` struct to represent model information
- Created `list_models.rs` example demonstrating model listing
- Updated documentation with model listing functionality

✅ **Non-streaming Generation API**
- Implemented `generate_text()` method using `/ml/v1/text/generation` endpoint
- Added `perform_text_generation()` internal method
- Renamed `generate_stream_with_callback()` to `generate_text_stream()` for consistency
- Renamed `perform_generation()` to `perform_text_stream_generation()` for consistency
- Created `streaming_vs_non_streaming.rs` example comparing both methods
- Updated all examples and documentation with consistent method names
- Added non-streaming flow to architecture documentation

✅ **Documentation Improvements**
- Completely rewrote README with focus on easy learning and usage patterns
- Added clear model selection requirement in all examples
- Added "Available Models" section with popular model recommendations
- Added dynamic model discovery examples
- Emphasized WatsonX platform vision (ai, data, governance, orchestrate)
- Created pattern-based learning approach instead of API reference style

✅ **Crates.io Publishing Fix**
- Fixed Cargo.toml categories to use supported crates.io category slugs
- Removed unsupported "artificial-intelligence" category
- Updated to use "api-bindings", "web-programming", "text-processing"

## Current Status

The SDK is fully functional with:
- ✅ Real-time streaming text generation (`generate_text_stream()`)
- ✅ Standard text generation (`generate_text()`)
- ✅ Proper SSE parsing for WatsonX streaming endpoint
- ✅ Environment-based configuration
- ✅ Multiple model support with updated constants
- ✅ Model listing API integration
- ✅ Quality assessment tools
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Working examples with consistent method names

## Future Improvements

### Potential Features
- [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Add support for more granular streaming control
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for better performance
- [ ] Add metrics and observability features
- [ ] Support for batch requests
- [ ] Chat completion API support
- [ ] Add examples for different use cases (chat, code generation, etc.)
- [ ] Implement caching for authentication tokens

### Documentation
- [ ] Add more detailed API documentation
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add migration guide from other SDKs

### Testing
- [ ] Add more integration tests
- [ ] Add mock server for testing
- [ ] Improve test coverage
- [ ] Add load testing scenarios

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add more code comments
- [ ] Refactor for better separation of concerns
- [ ] Add clippy lints
- [ ] Improve error messages

## Notes

- The SDK currently uses the streaming endpoint (`text/generation_stream`) for all generation requests
- Authentication tokens are not cached (re-authenticates on each connection)
- All examples follow the streaming pattern for real-time output
- Configuration is primarily via `.env` files for security
